From Joey:

 

I used the SNAP software to view the files, and upload text files to insert coordinates. I think you can do a lot of processing and exporting with the software but havenâ€™t looked at it further.

 

If I need processed data, such as ice concentration, I use AMSR2. I get them from here: https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/data/
